C# desktop application that makes use of wallhaven.cc API v1 to retrieve and set desired desktop wallpapers, depending on the user's screen resolution. Users may provide desired search tags and choose between the vast library of wallpapers available on the site. 

The wallpaper scheduler is now fully functional, though the estimated time for next change is not accurately represented.

All downloaded wallpapers including the original wallpaper will be safely stored under "WPDroid" folder inside "My Pictures" directory.
